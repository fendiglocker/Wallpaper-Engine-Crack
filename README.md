Important [2024]!

The release of the program is distributed on hundreds of thousands of devices. It is a complete copy of the original version with added activation. 100% working! We are not Wallpaper Engine developers, and therefore we cannot respond to bug reports from users (in comments and feedback), as well as provide support whose powers go beyond the website vsthemes.org . As for the problems of the "black screen" type, as well as other similar ones: the most common case is the lack of a driver for the video card; an outdated (outdated) driver version or incorrect operation. In all cases, you need to use the latest, available version downloaded from the official AMD/Nvidia website. Also, be sure to make sure that there are DirectX files, the link to which is located in the description above.
